          description: "Reception centers for Asylum Seekers (“Centres d’Accueil de Demandeurs d’Asile » CADA) are public-funded structures which can welcome you and your family (partner and underage children) during the examination process of your asylum demand. Besides providing you with an individual or collective housing solution, you will get help to cover your daily needs and benefit from administrative, social and medical assistance."
          instructions: |
            To benefit from an accomodation in a reception center, you need to have applied for asylum in France and be able to prove it (asylum application attestation or receipt). The French Office for Immigration and Intergration (Office Français de l’Immigration et l’Intégration (OFII )) located where you filed your demand should offer an accomodation within 3 days, depending on availability.
            WARNING : The number of places in these centers are limited. If there is no accommodation left in your region, you might be directed to any CADA in France.
            Be careful, if you reject this proposal, you will not receive another one and won’t be able to benefit from the asylum seeker allowance.
            When you will have the answer for your asylum demand (accepted or refused by the Ofpra or the CNDA), you must leave the CADA within the agreed period of 6 months.
